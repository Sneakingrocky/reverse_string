reverse_string
==============

This exercise was created to understand the work that Ruby's reverse method does work us.

<h2>What does Ruby's reverse method do?</h2>

<p>reverse → new_ary</p>
<p>Returns a new array containing self‘s elements in reverse order.</p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<code>
[ "a", "b", "c" ].reverse   #=> ["c", "b", "a"]
[ 1 ].reverse               #=> [1]</code>

<h3>Challenge #1</h3>

<p>To create a reverse method that reverses the string "Maverick is the best"</p>

OUTPUT
<code>"tseb eht si kcirevaM"</code>

<h3>Challenge #2</h3>

<p>Create a method that reverses the words of a given string in place: "Maverick likes bunnies"</p>

OUTPUT
<code>"kcirevam sekil seinnub"</code>
